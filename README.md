GeoGami is a location-based game that allows the user to play and create map-based games for any place in the world. Geogami is intended for users to improve their spatial cognition and orientation. It is created by the Spatial Intelligence Lab (SIL) of the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster.
With Geogami you can create your own games, mark your favourites and curate the list of games according to your needs.

For more information on **GeoGami** and our **research** visit the [Website](https://geogami.ifgi.de). The website is available in both English and German. 

## Run the app

GeoGami runs on iOS and Android devices with a compass sensor and a GPS or GSM module. The app is still under development and it would be helpful if you all contribute by reporting bugs and functional limitations here: [issues](https://github.com/origami-team/origami/issues).

You can install GeoGami...

1. **on your iOS device:** [Visit App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geogami/id1614864078).
2. **on your Android device:** [Visit Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifgi.geogami).

After installation, you can play the game but you can also be part of newer version updates by registering as a user. To do that, simply register using your email id and set up a strong password. With that you are ready to play.
